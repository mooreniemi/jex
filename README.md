Jex
===

Jex is an interactive tool for querying json files. It shows a json file in one pane, and the results of a [JQ query](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) on the right. You can update the query on the fly, allowing you to quickly iterate on your query and find out exactly what you're looking for.

If the file path is a valid url, a synchronous request will be made which assumes json was the exclusive response format.

Installing
----------

First, you need to have cargo, the rust package and build manager installed. You can install it by following the instructions at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

Once you have cargo installed, you can build and install jex by running
```
cargo install jex
```
